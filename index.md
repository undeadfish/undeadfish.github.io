### vscode-lpc-lang
An LPC syntax highlighter for Visual Studio Code based off of [poppa/pike-for-sublime](https://github.com/poppa/pike-for-sublime) for use in LP MUD development.

### vscode-pike-lang
A Pike syntax highlighter for Visual Studio Code based off of [poppa/pike-for-sublime](https://github.com/poppa/pike-for-sublime) because I'm already doing it for LPC since Pike is based off of LPC.

### IxiPlan
I've got the idea of a convention scheduler/planner, but I'm still struggling with what platform to write it in.  A simple, yet frustrating position of paralysis by analysis.

### SWmud Color Tool
This is an ancient little program designed to do GUI editing of text to be displayed on SWmud.  The problem is it was written over 15 years ago in VB6 and needs to be scrapped/re-written from scratch in something more modern.
